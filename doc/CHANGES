Changes from 0.1b to 0.2
------------------------
* Break size can now be set with the size parameter; previously it was
  hard-coded at around 1.4MiB.  You can specify 'B' (Bytes), 'K' (Kibibytes),
  'M' (Mebibytes), or 'G' (Gibibytes).

  The break size parameter is *not* required for rebuilding (in fact,
  it's not even used for rebuilding).
  
* The parts parameter to the "-r" rebuild option has been removed; it
  now uses a hard-coded max of 100 parts.  (I figured this would be a
  good amount.. hopefully you'll never use that many parts for distri-
  bution. :-)
  
* When rebuilding a file, you can specify either the first part or the
  original filename.
  
  ie:
    fbreak -r myfile.zip-part1
  or
    fbreak -r myfile.zip
