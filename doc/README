Introduction

	fbreak is a console application that allows you break large files
	into multiple smaller files (ie, for distribution on floppy disks).

Usage

	fbreak [-r] [-v] [sizeX] file

	    -r              rebuild file from parts
	    -v              verify integrity (to-do)

	    sizeX           break size (X=B,K,M,G)
	    file            file to break or rebuild

	* break size: default is 1.39M; if size is
	  specified but X is not, Bytes will be used
	* default action: break file into parts

Examples

	Breaking a file into parts:
	    fbreak 1.4M antivirus-signatures-full-20051115.exe
	This breaks this particular file into 4 files:
	 * antivirus-signatures-full-20051115.exe-part1 (1.40 MB)
	 * antivirus-signatures-full-20051115.exe-part2 (1.40 MB)
	 * antivirus-signatures-full-20051115.exe-part3 (1.40 MB)
	 * antivirus-signatures-full-20051115.exe-part4 ( 107 KB)
	
	Rebuilding a file from parts:
	    fbreak -r antivirus-signatures-full-20051115.exe-part1

To-Do

	* have it do 16MiB memory breaks
	* generate an MD5 sum file for parts and/or the original/rebuilt
	  (the MD5 sum code is already in place;  we just need it to
	   generate the MD5 sum file and implement verification of it)
	* possibly incorporate zlib to accomplish getting more data on
	  fewer floppy disks
