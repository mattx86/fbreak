Introduction

	fbreak is a console application that allows you break large files
	into multiple smaller files (ie, for distribution on floppy disks).

Usage

	fbreak [-r] [-v] file

	    -r parts        rebuild file from parts
	    -v              verify integrity (to-do)

Examples

	Breaking a file into parts:
		fbreak antivirus-signatures-full-20051115.exe
	This breaks this particular file into 4 files:
	 * antivirus-signatures-full-20051115.exe-part1 (1.40 MB)
	 * antivirus-signatures-full-20051115.exe-part2 (1.40 MB)
	 * antivirus-signatures-full-20051115.exe-part3 (1.40 MB)
	 * antivirus-signatures-full-20051115.exe-part4 ( 107 KB)
	
	Rebuilding a file from parts:
		fbreak -r 4 antivirus-signatures-full-20051115.exe
	Notice how we specify how many parts and the original filename.
	Right now the code is taking your word for how many parts are
	there;  this may or may not change in the future.

To-Do

	* generate an MD5 sum file for parts and/or the original/rebuilt
	  (the MD5 sum code is already in place;  we just need it to
	   generate the MD5 sum file and implement verification of it)
	* possibly incorporate zlib to accomplish getting more data on
	  fewer floppy disks
