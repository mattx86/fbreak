Windows, Visual C++ .NET 2003
-----------------------------
1. Open fbreak.sln
2. Select "Build"
3. Click "Build fbreak"
4. Look in .\Release\ sub-folder for fbreak.exe


UNIX, g++
---------
1. cd src/
2. g++ fbreak.c -o fbreak
3. You now have the binary "fbreak"

(The code is actually C, but the fmod() function that it uses
is a C++ function; hence the need to compile it with g++ for
now.)
