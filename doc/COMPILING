Windows, Visual C++ .NET 2003
-----------------------------
1. Open fbreak.sln
2. Select "Build"
3. Click "Build fbreak"
4. Look in .\Release\ sub-folder for fbreak.exe


UNIX, gcc
---------
1. cd src/
2. gcc -O2 fbreak.c -o fbreak
3. If all goes well, you should now have the binary "fbreak"

As of version 0.2.1, I've replaced the usage of fmod() with
good ole math -- fbreak can now be compiled as C code with gcc.

As of version 0.2.2, release optimizations have been checked
and tested.
